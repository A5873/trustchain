# Security Policy

## TrustChain Security Overview

TrustChain is a security-focused project that provides cryptographic verification for open source software supply chains. As such, we take security extremely seriously and have implemented numerous measures to ensure the integrity and security of our codebase and the systems using TrustChain.

This document outlines our security policy, including how to report vulnerabilities, our support policy, and best practices for securely using TrustChain.

## Supported Versions

We maintain security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.1.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 0.1   | :x:                |

As TrustChain is currently in early development, all versions are subject to significant changes. Once we reach a stable 1.0 release, we will provide a more comprehensive support policy with Long-Term Support (LTS) versions.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take all security vulnerabilities seriously. Thank you for improving the security of TrustChain.

**Do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them to:

```
security@trustchain.example.org
```

You should receive a response within 48 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message.

Please include the following information in your report:

- Type of vulnerability
- Full path of source file(s) related to the vulnerability
- Location of affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the vulnerability, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

## Security Update Process

When we receive a security bug report, we will assign it to a primary handler. This person will coordinate the fix and release process, involving the following steps:

1. Confirm the problem and determine the affected versions
2. Audit code to find any potential similar problems
3. Prepare fixes for all supported versions
4. Release patched versions and appropriate notifications

### Disclosure Timeline

- **0-48 hours**: Acknowledge receipt of vulnerability report
- **48-72 hours**: Initial assessment and triage
- **1-2 weeks**: Develop and test fixes
- **2-4 weeks**: Release security patches and advisory
- **30+ days after patch**: Public disclosure (if agreed with reporter)

This timeline may vary depending on the severity of the vulnerability and the complexity of the fix.

## Cryptographic Implementation Details

TrustChain uses a hybrid architecture with cryptographic operations implemented in Rust for performance and security:

- **Digital Signatures**: Ed25519 is used as the primary signature algorithm
- **Hash Functions**: SHA-256 and BLAKE3 are used for content verification
- **Random Number Generation**: Uses operating system entropy sources (e.g., `/dev/urandom` on Unix-like systems)
- **Key Derivation**: Argon2id for key derivation functions
- **Implementation**: Cryptographic primitives are implemented using well-audited libraries, primarily rust-crypto

### Cryptographic Validation

- We use formal verification techniques where possible
- Our cryptographic implementations undergo regular security audits
- We follow best practices for secure cryptographic implementations as outlined in NIST guidelines

## Threat Model

TrustChain is designed with the following threat model in mind:

1. **Trust Zone Boundaries**: Clear delineation of trust boundaries between components
2. **Zero Trust Approach**: Verification of all artifacts regardless of source
3. **Compromise Recovery**: Mechanisms to recover from compromise of individual components
4. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of verification and validation
5. **Adversary Capabilities**: Assumes sophisticated adversaries with significant resources

## Best Practices for Security

### For TrustChain Users

1. **Keep TrustChain Updated**: Always use the latest version with security patches
2. **Secure Key Management**:
   - Store private keys in secure hardware when possible (TPM, HSM, secure enclaves)
   - Use strong passphrases for key encryption
   - Implement proper key rotation procedures
3. **Trust Zone Configuration**:
   - Define clear trust boundaries in your projects
   - Use the principle of least privilege for verification policies
   - Regularly audit trust zone configurations
4. **Verification Practices**:
   - Always verify the entire dependency chain, not just direct dependencies
   - Enable automatic verification in CI/CD pipelines
   - Log and monitor verification failures
5. **Integration Security**:
   - When integrating TrustChain with other systems, maintain proper security controls
   - Use secure channels for communication between components
   - Apply defense in depth by combining TrustChain with other security tools

### For TrustChain Developers and Contributors

1. **Development Environment**:
   - Use isolated development environments
   - Keep development systems updated and secure
   - Use secure coding practices and static analysis tools
2. **Code Review**:
   - All security-critical code undergoes thorough review
   - Follow the secure coding guidelines in CONTRIBUTING.md
   - Run security-focused static analysis before submitting PRs
3. **Testing**:
   - Write comprehensive tests for security-critical functionality
   - Include negative tests that verify proper handling of invalid inputs
   - Use fuzz testing for parsing and cryptographic code
4. **Dependency Management**:
   - Regularly audit dependencies for security issues
   - Minimize use of third-party dependencies in security-critical paths
   - Pin dependency versions and use lockfiles

## Security Governance

TrustChain maintains a security governance process that includes:

1. Regular security audits of the codebase
2. Scheduled penetration testing
3. Periodic review of cryptographic implementations
4. Assessment of new threats and vulnerabilities
5. Community security bug bounty program (planned for post-1.0 release)

## Acknowledgments

We would like to thank the following individuals and organizations for their contributions to the security of TrustChain:

- Security researchers who have responsibly disclosed vulnerabilities
- Open source security projects that have provided tools and guidance
- Cryptographic libraries that provide secure implementations

This security policy is a living document and will be updated as our security practices evolve.
