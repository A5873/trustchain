# TrustChain Development Strategy

This document outlines the architecture, roadmap, and priorities for the TrustChain project.

## Project Overview

TrustChain is a distributed verification system for open source software components that establishes cryptographic proof of code integrity throughout the development lifecycle. The system combines Git-compatible cryptographic signing with distributed attestation nodes running on a peer-to-peer network to create verifiable chains of custody for codeâ€”from individual contributor commits to production deployments.

### Core Objectives

1. **Supply Chain Integrity**: Provide end-to-end verification of software components through the entire supply chain.
2. **Low Friction**: Integrate seamlessly with existing development workflows with minimal overhead.
3. **Distributed Trust**: Eliminate single points of failure and centralized trust authorities.
4. **Verifiable Provenance**: Enable consumers to verify the origin and integrity of software components.
5. **Scalable Security**: Support high-volume verification without performance degradation.
6. **Multi-language Support**: Provide SDKs for multiple programming languages.

## System Architecture

TrustChain uses a layered architecture with components implemented in different languages for optimal performance, security, and usability:

### Core Components

1. **Crypto Core (Rust)** - High-performance cryptographic operations:
   - Digital signatures (Ed25519, ECDSA)
   - Hash functions (BLAKE3, SHA-256, SHA-3)
   - Key management
   - FFI interfaces for Go/Python integration

2. **Service Layer (Go)** - Core services and peer-to-peer network:
   - Verification orchestration
   - Trust policies management
   - P2P network for distributed attestation
   - Trust zone management
   - REST API for external integrations

3. **Integration Layer (Python)** - Developer tools and ecosystem integrations:
   - CLI tools
   - Package manager integrations (pip, npm, cargo, etc.)
   - CI/CD integrations (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins)
   - IDE plugins
   - Visualization dashboards

### System Design Principles

1. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of verification to ensure security
2. **Zero Trust Model**: Every component and signature is verified
3. **Minimal Trust Anchors**: Reduce centralized trust authorities
4. **Auditability**: All verifications are logged and traceable
5. **Performance**: Minimal overhead for development workflows
6. **Extensibility**: Modular design for adding new cryptographic algorithms and integrations

## Security Considerations

### Threat Model

1. **Compromised Developer Accounts**
   - Mitigation: Multi-party signing requirements for critical components
   - Mitigation: Anomaly detection for unusual commit patterns

2. **Supply Chain Attacks**
   - Mitigation: Verification of all dependencies
   - Mitigation: Immutable build attestations
   - Mitigation: Reproducible build validation

3. **Cryptographic Weaknesses**
   - Mitigation: Use of modern, vetted cryptographic primitives
   - Mitigation: Algorithm agility with clear versioning
   - Mitigation: Regular cryptographic audits

4. **Certificate Authority Compromise**
   - Mitigation: Decentralized trust model
   - Mitigation: Multiple independent verification sources
   - Mitigation: Trust zone isolation

5. **Network-level Attacks**
   - Mitigation: Robust P2P protocol
   - Mitigation: Multiple attestation sources
   - Mitigation: Tamper-evident logs

### Security Principles

1. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of verification
2. **Zero Trust**: All components must be verified
3. **Least Privilege**: Minimal permissions for all operations
4. **Secure by Default**: Conservative default settings
5. **Transparency**: All verification steps are logged and auditable
6. **Simplicity**: Minimizing complexity to reduce attack surface
7. **Open Design**: No security through obscurity

## Development Workflow

1. **Test-Driven Development**
   - Comprehensive unit tests for all components
   - Integration tests for cross-component functionality
   - Fuzz testing for cryptographic operations

2. **Code Review**
   - All changes must be reviewed by at least one other developer
   - Security-sensitive code requires additional review
   - Regular security audits

3. **Continuous Integration**
